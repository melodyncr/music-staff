# music-staff

 This is the final project I completed for the Google-sponsore Computer Science Computing Imnitiative (CSSI). I collaborated with: Rafael Reyes-Gonzalez.
 
 We used the p5 javascript library to build a treble cleff music staff. The user can hover their mouse over the notes of the music staff and it will play its note. ALso changingthe color of the staff from black to a color of a rainbow.
 
 If you would like to setup and run this project, you can download the repository and open the index.html file in a web browser.
